## Cplusplus Program

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I chose project three, the Wildlife Zoo. The project involved testing system integration and design concepts to ensure they are feasible and deliver the required functionality. I created the project in an IDE, using the `TheZoo.cpp` file to link to the Java class using JNI, specifically the `ZooFileWriter.java` file.

### What did you do particularly well?
I felt that I did particularly well in uploading the files into Eclipse, completing the code, and following the Wildlife Zoo interface guide used in assignment 6-3 when setting up the JNI from HelloWorld. Including all the functional requirements made it easier to debug the code. In Module Six assignment, I built the pathways for the project.

### Where could you enhance your code?
I enhanced the code by going into more detail about each line of code in the `TheZoo.cpp` file.

### How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The improvements make my code more efficient and secure by providing more detail within each line of code. This helps me understand the different steps I took when linking a C++ to a Java class file using JNI in future assignments.

### Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this?
Yes, I did find some parts challenging. I overcame these challenges by making my code simple to run and including a README. I read the instructions carefully, focused on the test input, sought help when needed, carefully reviewed the code, and kept it organized. Getting useful criticism on my code also helped.

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The tools and resources I am adding to my support network include the supporting materials that helped me complete the code, such as textbooks and websites.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
The skills from this project that are particularly transferable to other projects and coursework include understanding how to link a C++ to a Java class file using JNI.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by maintaining clean code, keeping my code organized, and including simple notes for each line of code.
